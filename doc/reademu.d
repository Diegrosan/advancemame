Name
	advmame - The Advance Emulators

	AdvanceMAME/MESS/PAC are unofficial MAME/MESS/PacMAME versions for DOS,
	Linux and Windows with an advanced video support for helping the use
	with TVs, Arcade Monitors, Fixed Frequencies Monitors and also for PC
	Monitors.

	The official site of AdvanceMAME/MESS/PAC is :

		http://advancemame.sourceforge.net

	WARNING! TO PREVENT HARDWARE DAMAGE IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU
	CORRECTLY CONFIGURE YOUR MONITOR FREQUENCIES WITH THE CORRECT CLOCKS.
	SEE THE FILE INSTALL.TXT FOR OTHER INFORMATIONS.

	The main difference compared with the official emulators is that
	the Advance versions try always to use a video mode with the
	correct size and frequency. You can't get it only due physical hardware
	limitations and not due software limitations (i.e. VESA/DOS/Windows).

	Generally the Advance emulators are able to use a video mode which
	doesn't require any stretching or other unneed effects to match the
	original arcade display.
	When the stretching is required by hardware limitations you can anyway
	choice from different types of stretch.

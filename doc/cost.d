	cost - Estimated Cost

	This is a cost estimation of the Advance Projects
	generated using the SLOCCount program by David A. Wheeler from :

	All the source imported from other libraries or projects are excluded
	from these stats. The SLOCCount program automatically ignore any
	duplicated file.

	A SLOC is a physical Source Line of Code also called "non-blank,
	non-comment line".

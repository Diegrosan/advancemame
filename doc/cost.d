	cost - Estimated Cost

	This is a cost estimation of the Advance Projects
	generated using the SLOCCount program by David A. Wheeler from :

		http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/

	The MAME, MESS, PacMAME, SVGALIB and MPGLIB sources, and all the
	automatically generated files are execluded from these stats.
	The SLOCCount program automatically ignore any duplicated file.

	:Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 1.62 (19.47)
	:Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 11.39
	:Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 2,497,173

	A SLOC is a physical Source Line of Code also called "non-blank,
	non-comment line".

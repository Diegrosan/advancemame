Name
	cost - Estimated Cost

	This is a cost estimation of the Advance Projects
	generated using the SLOCCount program by David A. Wheeler from :

		http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/

	Only the specifically written for the Advance project are present
	in this estimation. The sources imported from other projects,
	data files, and automatically generated files are excluded from the
	estimation.

	A SLOC is a physical Source Line of Code also called "non-blank,
	non-comment line".

Totals
	:Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 110,966
	:Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 17.20 (206.43)
	:Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 1.58 (18.95)
	:Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 10.89
	:Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 2,323,791

	The estimate is computed with the Intermediate COCOMO model in
	"Organic" mode with an effort factor of 1.47. The effort factor is
	computed from the default value 2.3 with the following application
	cost drivers:

	:Required software reliability          0.88 (Low)
	:Database size                          0.94 (Low)
	:Execution time constraint              1.11 (High)

	and with the following common environment cost drivers:

	:Virtual machine volatility             0.87 (Low)
	:Use of "modern" programming practices  0.82 (Very High)

	All the other cost drivers were considered Nominal (1.0).
	The analysts/programmers capability and experience were
	intentionally considered nominal.

	You may be surprised by the high cost estimates, but note that they are
	supposed for a typical software development company. These include
	design, coding, testing, documentation (both for users and for programmers),
	and a wrap rate for corporate overhead (to cover facilities, equipment,
	accounting, and so on). Many programmers forget these other costs and
	are shocked by the high figures.

	The Advance project, as Open Source project, has no corporate overhead.

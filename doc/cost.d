	cost - Estimated Cost

	This is a cost estimation of the Advance Projects
	generated using the SLOCCount program by David A. Wheeler from :

		http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/

	The MAME, MESS, PacMAME, SVGALIB and MPGLIB sources, and all the
	automatically generated files are excluded from these stats.
	The SLOCCount program automatically ignore any duplicated file.

	A SLOC is a physical Source Line of Code also called "non-blank,
	non-comment line".

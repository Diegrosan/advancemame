AdvanceMAME 0.56.2

This is a big update for AdvanceMAME with a lot of changes.
Don't uncompress the new archives in your MAME directory, but create
a new one.

To convert your old mame.cfg to the new format follow these steps :

1) Rename your configuration file as "mame.cfg" if it has a different name
2) Copy it in the same directory of "advmame.exe"
3) Ensure that a file named "advmame.rc" doesn't exist.
4) Run "advmame.exe"
5) A file named "advmame.rc" should be now present in your current directory.

This conversion works only for the DOS version of AdvanceMAME.

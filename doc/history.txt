AdvanceMAME Version 0.61.0 2002/06
	) Upgraded at the SVGALIB 1.9.15 library.
	) Added the `vertical' and `horizontal' sections on the

		different configuration for vertical and horizontal
		games. If you have a rotating monitor, you can
		always configure the correct orientation.
	) The `display_rotate auto' option now select always the
		`blit' rotation. The reasion of this change is that
		the `core' rotation will be completly removed on the
		next MAME version (0.62).
		On monoprocessor machines this may result in a
		sensible slowdown on some games. Instead, on SMP
		(multiprocessor) machines all these games are now
		faster because the rotation is done in the parallel
		blit thread.

		converted to 8 bit.
	) Added the device_video_singlescan/doublescan/interlace
		options to disable the use of some mode types.
	) Rewritten the `vgaline' DOS driver. Now it never uses the
		BIOS to set the video mode.
	) The MNG files now use the FRAME chuck to specify a
		precise timing.
	) Added the `misc_quiet' option to disable the text message :
		"AdvanceMAME - Copyright (C) 1999-2002 by..."
	) Fixed some imprecisions on the image stretch.
	) Completed the color conversion functions.

AdvanceMAME Version 0.58.1 2002/03

		modes for games with less than 256 colors without
		problems. You can also use 8 bit modes for all the other 
		games but you lose in color precision.
	) The modeline format is changed. The new format is independent 
		of the video driver and of video board. The modelines 
		can now be exchanged between users.
	) Added a new set of video drivers called `svgaline' from
		the Linux SVGALIB library. These drivers overperform
		the old `vbeline' drivers. The old drivers are still
		supported anyway.

	) The sources are now completly indipendent from the MAMEDOS
		sources. They stay in a new directory called `advance'.
		Check the updated `build.txt' to compile.
	) The configuration file is now named like the executable.
		For example "mamepp.exe" checks for "mamepp.cfg".
	) Added the `videodepth' option to control the bit depth of the
		video mode used. The old `depth' option is still present 
		but control only the internal size of the working MAME 
		bitmap.
	) Added the command line option `-default' to create a default
		`mame.cfg' file.
	) Removed the `videogenerate=adjustxy' option.
	) Removed all the -list* and -verify* options. These will may be
		added in a future version with an external utility.
		Only the -listinfo option is maintained.
	) Updated the `mv' and `cfg' utility at the new features.
	) Updated the `card.txt' file with a complete list of the video
		board supported.
	) The safeexit option now uses the safequit.dat file to check if 
		the exit is safe or not. If the game is in demo mode and no
		coin is inserted the "Continue/Exit" menu is not shown.
		[Filipe de V. Estima (Bugfinder), Ian Patterson]
	) The `soundcard' option now uses text tag and not numbers.
		The tags are :
		auto - Automatic detection
		sb - Sound Blaster
		awe32 - Sound Blaster AWE 32 (probably the 'sb' driver is faster)
		pas - Pro Audio Spectrum
		gusmax - Gravis Ultrasound Max
		gus - Gravis Ultrasound
		wss - Windows Sound System
		ess - Ensoniq Soundscape

		Something like 55-125 Hz.
	) Added the `[config] magnify' option to suggest the use of
		a double resolution.
	) Added the `[config] rgb' to suggest the use of a true RGB mode.

	) Added the option `[config] vsync_adjust'. If it's set to `yes'
		AND the `vsync' is enabled all the `vbeline' modes
		are adjusted to match the exact frame rate of the
		emulated game. This option makes sense only with a PC
		multisync monitor which can accept a wide range of
		vertical and horizontal frequencies.
		Try with :

		[config]
		vsync = yes
		vsync_adjust = yes

		Note that if the vsync is enabled you are very limited
		in changing the video mode at runtime.
	) Solved some bugs in the `r128' driver. Now working.
	) Now `mame' doesn't add any default video modes if the list
		defined in the `mame.cfg' file is empty. You MUST use

	) Now the required hclock/vclock specification for a LCD screen	are:
		[video]
		hclock = 0
		vclock = 0
	) The default keys for the video mode change at runtime are now
		`,' (COMMA) and `.' (STOP) for preventing clash with the
		hotrod settings.

	) Removed the complete clear of all the video memory for
		problems with some NeoMagic cards (possible Segmentation
		fault)

	disable them with the option:
		[video]
		vbeline_driver = no

	) Added the contrib/xfree directory with some very useful
		technical documentation of video stuffs
	) Changed the diplay format of the video mode list in `mame'
	) Updated a lot the file `mame.txt'
	) Added the support for a second mouse imported from OptiMAME
		by Andy Geez. You can found the custom mouse driver

		disabled like the official mame. (auto->yes, missing->no)
	) Added some new `vbeline' modes for PAL/NTSC
	) Added the resize command with the CTRL+ARROW keys in the `mv'
		test screen

	I am interested in functionality reports with these information:
	1) Model of your video board
	2) The runtime log file "mv.log" generated with the command 
	"mv -log"  when you test (pressing ENTER) all the `vbeline' 
	video modes available.
	3) The list of `vbeline' video modes that display incorrectly

AdvanceMAME Version 0.37b3.1 (never released)
	) Corrected a lot of bugs in the blitters when the rotation
		and effects are active together (segmentation fault)
	) Corrected a bug in the palette conversion from 16 to 8 bit
		(slow down)

		doesn't require the file `mm.fnt'
	) Added the automatic creation and updating of the file `info.txt'
		in the `mm' utility
	) Added all the VSyncMAME drivers. See the new option
		`vbeline_driver' in the `mv.txt' file. Very

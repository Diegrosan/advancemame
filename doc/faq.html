AdvanceMAME FAQ
</h2>
<h3><a name="1.1">1.1</a> 
Is the Linux version of AdvanceMAME able to program my video board ?
</h3>
Yes. It uses both the SVGALIB library and FrameBuffer kernel service
to directly program the video board.
<h3><a name="1.2">1.2</a> 
Is the DOS version of AdvanceMAME able to program my video board ?
</h3>
Yes. It uses a modified version of the Linux SVGALIB library that
allows the direct programming the video board.
<h3><a name="1.3">1.3</a> 
Is the Windows version of AdvanceMAME able to program my video board ?
</h3>
Yes in Windows NT/2000/XP. It uses a modified version of the
Linux SVGALIB library, called SVGAWIN, that allows the direct
programming of the video board. In Windows 98/Me you can use
the DOS version to directly program your video board.
<h3><a name="1.4">1.4</a> 
How to automatically record video and audio clips ?
</h3>
Add this script in your advmame.rc. For any game started a 15 seconds
clip is recorded.
<p>
<pre>
script_emulation delay(5000); \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simulate_event(ui_snapshot, 50); \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simulate_event(ui_record_start, 50); \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delay(15100); \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simulate_event(ui_record_stop, 50); \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delay(100); \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simulate_event(ui_cancel, 50);
</pre>

AdvanceMENU FAQ
</h2>
<h3><a name="2.1">2.1</a> 
Why the mouse and the joystick don't work ?
</h3>
As default, the mouse and joystick inputs are disabled.
To enable them you can use the `device_mouse auto' and
`device_joystick auto' options.
<h3><a name="2.2">2.2</a> 
I have always the message "Updating the ... information file ..."
</h3>
The information file is recreated if the emulator executable
is newer. If this happen all the time, probably you have
a wrong time setting on your system.
<h3><a name="2.3">2.3</a> 
Can I use AdvanceMENU to list my MP3 and MNG collection ?
</h3>
Yes. You can create a fake emulator to play all your music
and video clips. Add the following options in your
advmenu.rc :
<p>
<pre>
emulator "mng" generic ""
emulator_altss "mng" "C:\CLIP"
emulator_roms "mng" "C:\CLIP"
emulator_roms_filter "mng" "*.mng"
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
emulator "mp3" generic ""
emulator_altss "mp3" "C:\MP3;C:\MUSIC"
emulator_roms "mp3" "C:\MP3;C:\MUSIC"
emulator_roms_filter "mp3" "*.mp3"
</pre>
<h2><a name="3">3</a> 
DOS FAQ
</h2>
<h3><a name="3.1">3.1</a> 
How can I solve the compiler error "Argument list too long (E2BIG)"
and "Error -1" ?
</h3>
If compiling you get the "Argument list too long" error,
or "Error -1" you need to use the DJGPP stubedit utility
to increase bufsize value for some DJGPP tools, with the
following commands:
<p>
<pre>
stubedit c:\djgpp\bin\gcc.exe bufsize=32k
stubedit c:\djgpp\bin\ld.exe bufsize=32k
stubedit c:\djgpp\bin\make.exe bufsize=32k
stubedit c:\djgpp\lib\gcc-lib\djgpp\3.23\collect2.exe bufsize=32k
</pre>
<p>
You may need to use different paths to the files,
especially for collect2.exe.
<h3><a name="3.2">3.2</a> 
What's the best configuration in PURE DOS ?
</h3>
My favorite choice is to use HIMEM, EMM386 and a little
cache with SMARTDRV.
<p>
In CONFIG.SYS:
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<pre>
dos=high
device=C:\DOS\W98\HIMEM.SYS
device=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS NOVCPI
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
In AUTOEXEC.BAT:
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<pre>
smartdrv 1024
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
If you have a lot of RAM you can use a bigger disk cache like :
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<pre>
smartdrv 8192
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<h3><a name="3.3">3.3</a> 
Why can I use only 32M of RAM ? I have more RAM.
</h3>
Start the EMM386.EXE device in your CONFIG.SYS with the
"NOEMS NOVCPI" arguments.
<h3><a name="3.4">3.4</a> 
Why can I use only 64M of RAM ? I have more RAM.
</h3>
Don't use the DOS 6.22 version of the HIMEM.SYS device. Use a
newer version, the Windows 98 version works good. You don't
need to upgrade your DOS, simply copy the newer HIMEM.SYS
from a Windows 98 installation.
<h3><a name="3.5">3.5</a> 
Which is the minimum memory requirement ?
</h3>
With 64 MB of memory you are able to play all the games.
At least in PURE DOS with CWSDPMI 5 and with 512 MB of virtual
memory.
<h3><a name="3.6">3.6</a> 
Which is the maximum memory required ?
</h3>
With 128 MB you should be able to play all the games without
any big speed loss. For the bigger games you may need 512
MB of virtual memory.
<h3><a name="3.7">3.7</a> 
How can I use two mouse ?
</h3>
To use the second mouse support you need the mouse driver
in the contrib/optimous directory. It's also present
a short text instruction file.
<h2><a name="4">4</a> 
Linux FAQ
</h2>
<h3><a name="4.1">4.1</a> 
How can I load the svgalib_helper.o kernel module automatically ?
</h3>
Insert this line :
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<pre>
alias char-major-209 svgalib_helper
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
in your /etc/modules.conf file and run only one time :
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<pre>
depmod -a
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
After that the module is loaded automatically every time is
needed.
<h3><a name="4.2">4.2</a> 
On scrolling games I see a missing frame every 5/10 seconds, also
with vsync enabled. How can I fix it ?
</h3>
If you are using a gameport joystick try disabling the joystick support
with the `device_joystick none' option.
<p>
Or upgrade at the svgalib 1.9.16 library which supports
for some boards the vsync IRQ.
<h3><a name="4.3">4.3</a> 
Using the last svgalib and enabling vsync I report random freeze
of the system.
</h3>
Try using the svgalib patch in the contrib/svgalib directory or
downgrade at the version 1.9.15 or 1.9.14.
<h3><a name="4.4">4.4</a> 
How can I enable the XFree86 DGA extension ?
</h3>
Ensure that in your XF86Config file the line :
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<pre>
Option    "omit xfree86-dga"
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
is not present or commented. To test it you can use
the `dga' utility. Run :
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<pre>
man dga
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<h3><a name="4.5">4.5</a> 
I have some background system activity, and the emulate game are
not playing smootly. How fix this ?
</h3>
To run AdvanceMAME the system must be almost in idle state.
<p>
Anyway, to reduce "jumpy" effect you can disable the vertical
vsync. The problem with vsync is that if the system is busy on
a vsync the result is a complete frame drop (a wait of 17 ms).
<h3><a name="4.6">4.6</a> 
Can I run AdvanceMENU directly from /etc/inittab ?
</h3>
The SVGALIB library needs a controlling tty and programs using it
cannot be run directly from init. You can anyway start them in
a shell, like :
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<pre>
::respawn:-/bin/sh -c advmenu
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
or write a simple program wrapper which sets a tty and
execs the program you want, like :
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<pre>
i=open("/dev/tty1", O_RDWR);
ioctl(i, TIOCSCTTY, 1);
exec(...)
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<h3><a name="4.7">4.7</a> 
Can I run the Advance programs in a readonly filesystem ?
</h3>
Yes. All the writable files are put in the $HOME/.advance
directory. If they are readonly, they are not updated.
<h2><a name="5">5</a> 
Windows FAQ
</h2>
<h3><a name="5.1">5.1</a> 
The SVGAWIN driver doesn't seem to work with my video board. How can I
solve this ?
</h3>
The SVGAWIN driver is experimental. At present it's only tested
on Windows 2000 with a GeForce 2 board. It may not work will all
the other boards.
<p>
The svgawin drivers are inherently unsafe because they should coexist
with the normal Windows drivers.
<p>
The most common problem is that the Windows driver sets the video
card in a state that the SVGAWIN driver cannot understand or
restore.
<p>
The only possible solution is to try to reduce the video hardware
acceleration at the minimum in
DisplayProperties/Settings/Advanced/Troubleshooting.
<p>
If you want a stable solution you must use the Linux or DOS
version of AdvanceMAME and AdvanceMENU.
<p>
Alternatively you can try to use two different video boards, one for
Windows and the other for the game display. Check the
`device_svgawin_skipboard' option to control which video board to use.
<h3><a name="5.2">5.2</a> 
How disable the Windows hotkeys ?
</h3>
Check the Microsoft online documents "Disabling the Windows Key
on Microsoft Natural Keyboard" at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=181348">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=181348</a>.
<h2><a name="6">6</a> 
Video FAQ
</h2>
<h3><a name="6.1">6.1</a> 
How can I enable the TV-OUT signal (S-VIDEO) of the video board ?
</h3>
You cannot. If the TV-OUT signal is not enabled automatically
by your video board you cannot enable it manually.
<p>
If you have a TV with SCART input (all european TVs) you can buy
or build a VGA to SCART cable.
<h3><a name="6.2">6.2</a> 
Which is the "tearing" effect ?
</h3>
The tearing effect is a defects of the animation caused by a wrong
synchronization with the game refresh rate and the video mode refresh
rate. It generally appears as a horizontal image split line, on the
top of this line you see the previous game frame, on the bottom of this
line you see the next game frame.
<p>
If the game and the video refresh rate are only a little different
the tearing split line is slowly moving up or down. If the refreshes are
very different the split line is moving randomly.
<p>
The tearing effect is mostly noticeable in games with a continuously
scrolling background.
<h3><a name="6.3">6.3</a> 
How can I remove the tearing effect ?
</h3>
The only way to remove the tearing effect is to enable the
`display_vsync' option. To correctly work this option need a video
mode with a refresh rate which is a multiplier of the original game
refresh rate. For example for a 50 Hz game you can use video modes
of 50, 100, 150 Hz.
<h3><a name="6.4">6.4</a> 
How can I reduce the tearing effect ?
</h3>
If for some reason you cannot use the `display_vsync' option the
only way to reduce the tearing effect is to choose a video mode
refresh rate which ensure to have a randomly and fast moving tearing
split line.
<p>
Generally they are high refresh rates, prime with the original game
frequency.
<h3><a name="6.5">6.5</a> 
Does the "double/tripler buffer" help to reduce the tearing effect ?
</h3>
No. A generic asynchronous buffer doesn't remove or reduce the
tearing effect. A synchronous buffer instead it's exactly like
the vsync. AdvanceMAME supports only the asynchronous buffers.
<h3><a name="6.6">6.6</a> 
Can I get a good animation with a video mode with arbitrary frequency ?
</h3>
There is no way to get a perfect animation without using
a video mode with the same game refresh rate. You will get the
tearing effect or a not smooth animation from some frames skipped
or displayed too long.
<p>
For example, suppose to use a 70 Hz video mode with a 60 Hz game.
You can display every frame for 1/60 of second and get the tearing
effect. Alternatively you can display every frame for 1/70 of second,
but after 7 frame you need to display a frame for 2/70 of second to
synchronize with the original game speed.
<p>
The only exception is for frequencies which are multiplier of
the original game refresh rate.
<h3><a name="6.7">6.7</a> 
Why the smaller video modes like 256x224 are not working ?
</h3>
Probably your video board isn't able to generate very low
pixelclocks. You can try to increase the minimum value of the
`device_video_pclock' option. The video mode generation will
automatically generate video modes with double or triple
horizontal resolutions to force the use of a pixelclock in
the specified range.
<h2><a name="7">7</a> 
License FAQ
</h2>
<h3><a name="7.1">7.1</a> 
Is MAME Open Source ?
</h3>
No. The MAME License is not an Open Source License as defined
at <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">http://www.opensource.org/</a>.
<h3><a name="7.2">7.2</a> 
Is MAME Free Software ?
</h3>
No. The MAME License is not a Free Software License as defined
at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">http://www.gnu.org/</a>.
<h3><a name="7.3">7.3</a> 
Is AdvanceMAME Open Source and Free Software ?
</h3>
Yes. AdvanceMAME is released with the GPL License which is
an Open Source and a Free Software License.
<h3><a name="7.4">7.4</a> 
Which is the license of the AdvanceMAME source ?
</h3>
The AdvanceMAME project is released under the GPL license.
<p>
In addition you have some extra rights granted by a special
license exception which allow you to link the AdvanceMAME GPL
source with the not GPL MAME source.
<p>
The exception give also to you the rights to eliminate it
if you don't like it or if you want to include the
AdvanceMAME source in another GPL program. So, AdvanceMAME
is 100% GPL.
<p>
You can more easily think at it as a sort of double license.
A GPL or a GPL + exception. You have all the rights of the
GPL, and, if you want, some others.
<p>
The only limitation is for AdvanceMAME. AdvanceMAME cannot
include external GPL source without the explicit permission
of the source copyright holder.
<h3><a name="7.5">7.5</a> 
Why the AdvanceMAME license is called GPL if it's different
than the GPL ?
</h3>
The GPL license used by AdvanceMAME isn't modified in any
way.
<p>
The license exception is added outside the GPL license text.
It's added at the top of every source files for which the
exception has the validity.
<p>
How to add this sort of exceptions is specifically covered on
the Official GPL FAQ written by the same people which have
written the GPL license and which are the copyright holders
of the GPL license.
<p>
Specifically, in the Official GPL FAQ you can see that in
every source files with the license exception you must add

Which explicitly claims that the program with the license
exception is still GPL.
<h3><a name="7.6">7.6</a> 
Does the MAME license allow linking the MAME source with
a GPL source ?
</h3>
Yes. The only requirement of the MAME License for the
derivative works is the whole source availability.
With the GPL you have it.
Obviously this assuming that the MAME License isn't changed
and it maintains complete validity.
<h3><a name="7.7">7.7</a> 
Does the GPL license allow to link a GPL source with a
MAME source ?
</h3>
No. The GPL license requires that the whole program be
released with the GPL license or with a GPL compatible
license. The MAME License isn't a GPL compatible license.
<h3><a name="7.8">7.8</a> 
Does the GPL license + exception allow linking a
GPL + exception source with a MAME source ?
</h3>
Yes. The license exception specifically allows it.
<h3><a name="7.9">7.9</a> 
The license exception say "MAME library". Is MAME a library or
a program ?
</h3>
AdvanceMAME uses only the internal MAME core, which is
effectively a library.  For example MESS is distributed with
the MAME core as a DLL (Dynamic Linked Library) and two
different frontends as .EXE files.
<p>
Anyway, calling a software program or library doesn't change
his license.
<h3><a name="7.10">7.10</a> 
The GPL FAQ say: "Combining two modules means connecting
them together so that they form a single larger program. If
either part is covered by the GPL, the whole combination must
also be released under the GPL--if you can't, or won't, do
that, you may not combine them.". Is it true ?
</h3>
Yes. But the GPL FAQ speak of a generic GPL program without
any exception.
<p>
The license exception explicitly allows you to combine the
GPL program with MAME. These exceptions exist specifically
to solve this problem. Essentially, if your GPL program need
to use another not GPL module, you (as copyright holder) can
grant at the user the rights to link it with the not GPL
module.
<p>
The GPL was made to protect the interests of the copyright
holder. But if the copyright holder wants, he can relax the
license adding specific exceptions that extend the rights of
the users. So, the users can do things not generally
permitted by the simple GPL license.
<h3><a name="7.11">7.11</a> 
Which is the license of the AdvanceMAME binary ?
</h3>
The AdvanceMAME binary contains source from AdvanceMAME,
MAME, Allegro, SEAL, svgalib, zlib and FreeType2. You must
follow ALL these licenses when you use the binary.
So, you can do with it only things allowed by ALL these licenses.
<h3><a name="7.12">7.12</a> 
Can I sell the AdvanceMAME binary ?
</h3>
No. The AdvanceMAME binary contains compiled MAME source and
the "MAME License" prohibits selling.
<h3><a name="7.13">7.13</a> 
Why SourceForge accepted the AdvanceMAME project and not the
xmame project ?
</h3>
SourceForge accepts only Open Source licenses.
<p>
The source distribution of AdvanceMAME is released with
an Open Source license. So, it was accepted.
<p>
The xmame is released with the "MAME License". The MAME
License isn't an Open Source license as defined on
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/">http://www.opensource.org/</a>. So, it was rejected.
<h3><a name="7.14">7.14</a> 
Who is the copyright holder of AdvanceMAME ?
</h3>
Andrea Mazzoleni is the copyright holder of AdvanceMAME.
<p>
Some source and documentation files are also under the
copyright of Filipe Estima, Ian Patterson, Randy Schnedler,
S. Sakamaki.

GPL FAQ

This is an extract of the Official GPL FAQ present at :

<h3><a name="8.1">8.1</a> 
I am writing free software that uses non-free libraries.
What legal issues come up if I use the GPL?
</h3>
<p>
If the libraries that you link with falls within the
following exception in the GPL:
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<pre>
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
component itself accompanies the executable.
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
then you don't have to do anything special to use them. In
other words, if the libraries you need come with major parts
of a proprietary operating system, the GPL says people can
link your program with them.
<p>
If you want your program to link against a library not
covered by that exception, you need to add your own
exception, wholly outside of the GPL. This copyright notice
and license notice give permission to link with the program
FOO:

In addition, as a special exception, &lt;name of copyright

the FOO library (or with modified versions of FOO that use the
same license as FOO), and distribute linked combinations including
the two.  You must obey the GNU General Public License in all
respects for all of the code used other than FOO.  If you modify
this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the
file, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to
do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

<p>
Only the copyright holders for the program can legally
authorize this exception. If you wrote the whole program
yourself, then assuming your employer or school does not
claim the copyright, you are the copyright holder--so
you can authorize the exception. But if you want to use
parts of other GPL-covered programs by other authors in your
code, you cannot authorize the exception for them. You have
to get the approval of the copyright holders of those programs.
<p>
When other people modify the program, they do not have to
make the same exception for their code--it is their choice
whether to do so.
<p>
Adding this exception eliminates the legal issue, ...

<h3><a name="8.2">8.2</a> 
Is the developer of a GPL-covered program bound by the GPL? Could the
developer's actions ever be a violation of the GPL?
</h3>
<p>
Strictly speaking, the GPL is a license from the developer for others
to use, distribute and change the program. The developer itself is
not bound by it, so no matter what the developer does, this is not a
"violation" of the GPL.
<p>
However, if the developer does something that would violate the GPL
if done by someone else, the developer will surely lose moral
standing in the community.

<h3><a name="8.3">8.3</a> 
I want to distribute binaries, but distributing complete source is inconvenient.
Is it ok if I give users the diffs from the "standard" version along with the
binaries?
</h3>
<p>
This is a well-meaning request, but this method of providing the source
doesn't really do the job.
<p>
A user that wants the source a year from now may be unable to get the proper
version from another site at that time. The standard distribution site may have
a newer version, but the same diffs probably won't work with that version.
<p>
So you need to provide complete sources, not just diffs, with the binaries.

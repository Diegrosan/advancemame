; SAFEQUIT.DAT Version 0.02
; Data for the "safe quit" routines of AdvanceMAME
; Put this file in the same directory as the AdvanceMAME executable
; 
; This is the logic behind the "Safe Quit" engine:
; 
; IF (number of credits in game = 0) AND (game is in demo mode)
; {
;       enable the safe_quit (game can exit when asked)
; 	else
;       disable the safe_quit (game will show a confirmation screen)
; }
; 
; This file can be edited with a text editor, but keep the same format:
; all fields are separated by a colon (:)
;
; <gamename>:
; <event>:<cpu>:<address>:<action>:<mask>:<result>
; [repeat the above as many times as necessary]
;
; For <action> = 00
; Load <gamename> and get the value inside <address> on CPU <cpu> RAM area.
; Perform an AND operation with <mask> and compare with <result>.
; If they DO match for at least one second the  event <event> is TRUE.
;
; For <action> = 01
; Load <gamename> and get the value inside <address> on CPU <cpu> RAM area.
; Perform an AND operation with <mask> and compare with <result>.
; If they DO NOT match for at least one second the event <event> is TRUE.
;
; The field <event> can be "zero_coin" or "demo_mode"
;
; To enable the "Safe Quit" action, all listed events must be TRUE. 
; An event assumes the value FALSE immediately. To assume the value TRUE
; it's necessary ** ALL ITS COMPONENTS ** are TRUE for at least 1 second.
;
; The event "zero_coin" tests the "waiting coins" (not yet played).
; I searched for addresses corresponding to coin slot 1 only, but you are
; welcome to include addresses for other coin slots too.
;
; The event "demo_mode" tests the current game status. In some games it's
; necessary more than one address to determine the current game status.
; I call them "event components": a game is in play mode if any of the
; demo_mode components are FALSE. When all are TRUE together for at least
; one second then the event "demo_mode" is TRUE.
; 
; Some games simply don't seem to have a bit signaling demo mode, Rygar
; and Gemini Wings are examples. For this kind of games we need to have a
; master event. When we use a master event, things will work like this:
; 
; 1) Place a master event to work on zero_coin. When the game starts
; this event is TRUE because there are no coins inserted (unless we're
; running games with CMOS keeping coins like mk, berzerk). The "Safe Quit"
; button is kept enabled even if all demo_mode events are FALSE.
; 
; 2) Place normal events to work on demo_mode watching the player's lives
; (or energy etc).
; 
; 3) When a coin is inserted, the master event turns FALSE (coins > 0).
; This will disable the "Safe Quit" button.
; 
; 4) The player uses all coin(s) - this makes the master event TRUE.
; This time, to enable "Safe Quit" again, ** ALL ** events must be TRUE.
; Once all events are TRUE (game is over and no coins inserted), things
; restart from the beginning: since the master event is TRUE again, it's
; enough to keep enabled the "Safe Quit" button. The other events don't
; need to be TRUE until the master event turns FALSE and TRUE again.
; 
; 5) If the master event becomes FALSE again before all other normal
; events had turned TRUE (like, another coin inserted during a game)
; then go to step 3.
; 
; Master events have slightly different <action> codes. If we need
; to have a event with <action> 00 working as a master event,
; use 10 in <action> (same with <action> 01, use 11).
; 
; NOTE:
;
; Depending on the dipswitch setting about number of coin slots and
; simultaneous players, the address of the waiting coins may differ;
; an example of this behaviour is dino. The addresses in this file were
; found on games with 2 simultaneous players and one active coin slot.
; This doesn't mean they won't work on games configured for 3, 4 or more
; simultaneous players.
